    <h3 id="overview-">OVERVIEW:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>LEG is an acronym standing for Linux Execution Gang</li>
        <li>The “Gang” in the name refers to the CPU cores of the processor, as they are a gang of cores that execute Linux and related processes</li>
        <li>LEG has 256 bit instructions, meaning 256 bit registers</li>
        <li>LEG will have two different types of firmware (which we calle “vibeware”) UEFl (Unified Extendable Firmware LEG), and OpenFirmware</li>
        <li>The bootloader for UEFl will be an ELF (Executable LEG Format)</li>
        <li>The file in which UEFl uses is efl/boot/bootleg.efl</li>
        <li>The first LEG CPU will be released on leg day of 20xx</li>
        <li>Everytime the LEGStation crashes it makes the “My LEG” sound from SpongeBob Square Pants</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="strasciiaddmuldivavg-">STRASCIIADDMULDIVAVG:</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>This is an added instruction to LEG, it’ll be standard on all LEG CPUs</li>
       <li>This instruction will take an an integer and a string</li>
       <li>It converts each character of the string to their base 10 ASCII values and all added together</li>
       <li>This new value is multiplied by the length of the string</li>
       <li>Then this number is divided by the integer</li>
       <li>Then we return the average of this new number and the integer</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="legos-">LEGOS:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>LEGOS will only have one supported Window Manager and Desktop Environment</li>
        <li>LEGDE (pronounced LEG DAY) will combine the best elements of the popular Desktop Environments, it will also have a mobile variant</li>
        <li>LEGWM will have a floating and tiling version</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="middle-endian-">MIDDLE ENDIAN:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>We start off with the word. The most significant byte of this word is stored in the middle</li>
      <li>Then we take the two words that are on either side of the most significant byte</li>
      <li>We put those words’ most significant bytes in the middle</li>
      <li>Repeat until the entire word is sorted</li>
   </ul>
